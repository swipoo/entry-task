##### Exercise

With the provided API and documentation, create a UI that allows users to check the information of their vehicles and their standard tax value, with the corresponding deprecation depending on the enrollment date. For each year since the enrollment date, the vehicle receives 10% more depreciation applied to the standard value.

You can use the technology you feel more confortable with.

Even though it's nice to have good UI we'll focus on evaluating the structure of the project and the use of good practices.
